# Rasbeery brewing controller

This project aims at building a controller for a RIMS/HERMS brew setup. The
setup has up to five temperature sensors, and one pump. Additional goals are to
monitor the sparging, provide boil time information (hop additions), and
eventually to monitor fermentation and lagering.

## Some project goals
 * Complete logging of all relevant events
 * Complete recipe with water additions
 * Command line interface
 * Web interface
 * Notifications via email and text messages
 * Real time tweaking during operation
